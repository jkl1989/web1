The PHIX Starter Kit by MLV is a pod vaping system, which features a truly
closed loop system and a powerful 280 mAh battery. The kit has capacity
for 1 x 1.5ml e-juice pod crafted specifically for the device and each pod
offers around 400-450 pods dependent on your usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">You can also expect around 200-220 puffs of the Phix after you have fully charged it,
before it needs loading up again.
With a 3.7v output the Phix is easy to use and utilizes a patented
ceramic coil with resistance of 1.4 to 1.5 ohms.
It is charged via USB but is not a pass-through device
so you should not use this e-cig system when charging.</p>
<p>The kit makes it easy to get started on your vape journey or make the move to pod vaping.
The e-juice pod range incorporates a choice of different flavors to suit all vapers.</p>
